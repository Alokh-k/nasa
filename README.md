## üìñ About The Project

We‚Äôre Team **Aurea**, a group of developers and space enthusiasts specializing in planetary data visualization. For the NASA Space Apps Challenge, our goal was to develop AstraLens to address the challenge of making complex mission data accessible to a broad audience.

Raw orbital data from missions like **Apollo** and **ShadowCam** is often stored in vast tables that lack the immediate geographic context needed for discovery. AstraLens solves this by plotting thousands of real observations directly onto an interactive lunar map, making the data explorable for students, citizen scientists, and researchers alike.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Lunar Map**: Explore thousands of real observation points from historic NASA missions.
* **Mission Data Layers**: Toggle between datasets from Apollo (Metric, Pan, DPSC) and ShadowCam instruments.
* **Heatmap Analysis**: Instantly visualize the density of observations to discover patterns in mission targeting.
* **AI-Powered Summaries**: Each data point includes an AI-generated summary for immediate scientific context.
* **Distance Measurement Tool**: Calculate the distance between any two points on the lunar surface.
